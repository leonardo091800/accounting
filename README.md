accounting made easy

An easy program in PHP and MYSQL that can help my mum with her accounting stuff.

In future maybe I'll add the possibility to have multiple users, but I need to figure out how to hide/obfuscate sensitive data

It can work even locally in any pc, just install the XAMPP app and change the root path in the z.scripts/root.php file
In linux:
(after having installed git)
$ cd /tmp/
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/leonardo091800/accounting.git
$ cd accounting
$ sudo chmod +x INSTALL.sh
$ sudo ./INSTALL.sh

and it's done
